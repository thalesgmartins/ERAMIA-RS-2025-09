# Workshop

ECL course material for community workshops. The training cluster utilized during the workshop is: [TrainingCluster](https://eclwatch.br-training-prod.azure.lnrsg.io:18010/) and the [Queries interface](https://eclqueries.br-training-prod.azure.lnrsg.io:18002/). After completing this course, you should use: *localhost* or [PlayGroundCluster](https://play.hpccsystems.com:18010/).

**Note**: The '*persons*' and '*property.csv*' datasets are already sprayed and available in the training cluster utilized during the workshop.


# HPCC Systems platform

Environment for the HPCC-Systems big data platform.  This demo uses cloud developer environments (originally GitPod, currently migrated to [ONA](https://gitpod.io), now also [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)) to host a single node instance of the HPCC-System platform and VS Code (web based) with the ECL Extension pre-installed.

## Launch in GitHub Codespaces

Click the badge below to launch a Codespace using the new dev container configuration.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/alysson-oliveira/ERAMIA-RS-2025)

The Codespaces environment will:

* Build a custom container (see `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`) installing HPCC Systems platform 9.14.22-1 version
* Auto-start the HPCC services (`postStartCommand` runs `start-hpcc.sh` and `install-bundles.sh`)
* Forward port `8010` (ECL Watch) and `8002` (Roxie) 
* Install the VS Code extensions: `hpcc-systems.ecl` and `gordonsmith.observable-js`

### Codespaces Notes

* If the HPCC services fail to start (rare), run: `start-hpcc.sh` in the integrated terminal.
* To rebuild the container after changing devcontainer files: Command Palette → “Codespaces: Rebuild Container”.
* The legacy Gitpod config (`.gitpod.yml`) remains for backward compatibility; future improvements should target the dev container.
